    /*
    SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY
    Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled
    with excessive functionality.

    OPEN CLOSED
    Classes should be open for extension,
    closed for modification.

    LISKOV SUBSTITUTION
    This means that every subclass or derived class should
    be substitutable for their base or parent class.

    INTERFACE SEGREGATION
    Interfaces should not force classes to implement
    what they can't do.
    Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.
